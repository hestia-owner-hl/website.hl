<!--
  ‹Newsletter signup› Netlify Form definition, as static HTML,
  for the buildbots of Netlify.

  Must match the fields of the form rendered client-side
  by the ‹newsletter-signup› Web Component (see source
  code in `src/components/newsletter-signup.js`).

Note:
  Netlify buildbots find the forms by parsing the static HTML
  of the site when the build completes. As Web Components render
  their forms client-side, the buildbots don't find those forms.
  To work around this, a «shadow form» with similar structure
  must be added as static HTML, somewhere within the site,
  to be picked up and parsed by the buildbots.
