  Dating Privacy aims to understand how dating applications work, in particular
  how data is collected and processed, and how this affects interactions between
  users (who is introduced to whom).


  The project also provides dating apps users with a tool to visualize and understand the dating apps data ecosystem and its exploitation.


  In a first phase, this project will focus on the relevance of geolocation data.
