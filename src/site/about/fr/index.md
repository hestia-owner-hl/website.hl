story_title: A short story about us
story: >-
  The work of HestiaLabs' founder (the mathematician Paul-Olivier Dehaye) led to
  [the revelation of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica
  scandal](https://www.letemps.ch/societe/paulolivier-dehaye-matheux-ennemi-facebook)
  (2018) and the writing of "[Love under
  Algorithm](https://www.editionsgouttedor.com/single-post/2019/03/07/-l-amour-sous-algorithme-de-judith-duportail)",
  a [book deconstructing Tinder's
  algorithm](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/27/tinder-data-privacy-tech-eu-general-data-protection-regulation)
  (2019).


  “Paul-Olivier Dehaye is today one of the best experts on this issue in the world. His aim is not to climb this kind of summit any further. Rather to contribute to the emergence of solutions and instruments likely to bring about change”, wrote [Paris-Match](https://paris-match.ch/labecedaire-de-paul-olivier-dehaye/). HestiaLabs is one of them.
