ICTjournal, the reference media for IT decision-makers in French-speaking Switzerland, has dedicated [its front page to data sharing](https://www.ictjournal.ch/articles/2021-11-30/partager-les-donnees-pourquoi-comment-avec-qui). Now a common practice "between companies participating in the same supply chain" to "gain efficiency through paperless processes", data sharing between organizations is also becoming widespread to innovate better and faster.

"But it's not just companies that can benefit from data sharing. By forming trusts or founding a collective - like the initiatives of HestiaLabs and MIDATA - individuals can regain control over their personal data and decide how it will be used for their direct benefit or for public interest purposes," continues Rodolphe Koller, editor of the magazine.

Dedicated to "governance mechanisms that allow individuals to share their data while ensuring that it will serve their aspirations", [an article in this very complete dossier details the concept of data collectives](https://www.ictjournal.ch/articles/2021-11-30/comment-partager-les-donnees-collectivement-et-a-dessein) that we promote, and takes HestiaLabs as an example of implementation.
