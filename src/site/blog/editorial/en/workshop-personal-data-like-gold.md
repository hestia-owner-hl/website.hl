Discover a bit of one of the workshops organized by the data collectives [The Eyeballs](https://eyeballs.hestialabs.org/) and [Dating Privacy](https://dating-privacy.hestialabs.org/) thanks to the tools we developed for them: analysis of the data collected by [Facebook](https://experiences.hestialabs.org/facebook), [Twitter](https://experiences.hestialabs.org/twitter) or [Tinder](https://experiences.hestialabs.org/tinder) and the [AdRadar](https://github.com/hestiaAI/ad-radar) browser extension that displays the price of online ads on ads.
