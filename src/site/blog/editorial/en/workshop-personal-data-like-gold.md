Discover a bit of one of the workshops organized by the data collectives [The Eyeballs](https://eyeballs.hestialabs.org/) and [Dating Privacy](https://dating-privacy.hestialabs.org/) thanks to the tools we developed for them: analysis of the data collected by [Facebook](https://experiences.hestialabs.org/facebook), [Twitter](https://experiences.hestialabs.org/twitter) or [Tinder](https://experiences.hestialabs.org/tinder) and the [AdRadar](https://github.com/hestiaAI/ad-radar) browser extension that displays the price of online ads on ads.

Thanks to the participants for their involvement, their relevant questions and their feedback.

See you soon for new workshops.

In the meantime, feel free to check our [Vimeo page](vimeo.com/hestiaai) for more videos.
