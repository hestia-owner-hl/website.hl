      We put together individuals with a common problem with the use of their
      data or with a common problem that can be solved with their data and
      empower them with the technologies and ethical framework to solve it.


      We develop [tools](https://experiences.hestialabs.org) for [The Eyeballs 👀](https://eyeballs.hestialabs.org), a collective that reveal what is going on behind our screens when we read an article or scroll through content on social media: Why am I seeing this ad? How much is an advertiser paying to target me?


      We help the collective [Dating Privacy❤️](https://dating-privacy.hestialabs.org)  redefine the balance between the interests of dating app users and the interests of the platforms by mapping and exposing the data they collect.

      We lead [participatory trainings](/en/projects#data-literacy) based on
      real life examples to answer this very important question: How is our data
      used?


      A data collective around [mobility](/en/projects#mobility) and one for [platform workers](/en/projects#uber-drivers) are under construction. Many others will follow.


      This how HestiaLabs will deconstruct the idea that the current data valuation model is the norm and build a more ethical one.
